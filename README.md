- I learned techniques required to create the intergrated navbar items as well as the Orange highlight styling used on some of the card components
- In addition to using the layout design from the video, I created the additional guest and price pages
- Added JS styling to the navbar for the opacity change once scrolling has occured
- Added the Welcome loader when the page first loads
